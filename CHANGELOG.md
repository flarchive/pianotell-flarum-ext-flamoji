### 2.5.0 — 2026-07-02

- **Load emoji-mart from a CDN (optional).** A new "Load Emoji-Mart via CDN" admin toggle serves the emoji-mart library and emoji data from a third-party CDN (jsDelivr by default) instead of from your own server. It ships with pinned URLs and matching Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes, so integrity checking is on out of the box and both the script and the dataset are verified. If the CDN is unreachable — or an SRI hash doesn't match — the picker automatically falls back to the copy bundled with the extension, so it never breaks. Off by default; loading from an external origin requires your Content-Security-Policy (if any) to allow it. Thanks to @huoxin233 for the original contribution.
- **Faster first picker open, especially in sticker mode.** The emoji library, dataset, and your custom emoji now load in parallel. In sticker mode the picker skips downloading the ~460 KB Unicode emoji dataset entirely (it only needs your custom stickers), so it opens noticeably quicker.

### 2.4.1 — 2026-07-01

- **Fixed a rare memory leak** where closing the composer while the emoji picker was still loading — and that load then failed — could leave an orphaned loading placeholder and window listeners behind.
- **Internal:** refactored the picker into a Mithril component plus a dedicated controller class. No user-facing change.

### 2.4.0 — 2026-06-30

- **Style custom emojis by category from your own CSS.** Custom emojis now render with a `data-flamoji-category` attribute on the wrapping `<span>` carrying the emoji's category, so you can target them per category — e.g. `span.flamoji[data-flamoji-category="Stickers"] img { height: 35px }`. Uncategorized emojis are unchanged.

### 2.3.0 — 2026-06-26

- **Frequently Used now starts empty and reflects only emoji you've actually used.** On a fresh browser it previously pre-filled with emoji-mart's built-in "popular" defaults — generic Unicode emoji unrelated to your forum, and in sticker/custom-only mode (or with categories disabled) even emoji the picker couldn't insert. The tab now begins empty and fills from each member's own picks — the standard emoji-picker behavior — saved per browser.
- **Removed the "Pre-populate with popular emojis" admin setting** (added in 2.1.0). Suppressing those defaults is now built-in and unconditional, so the toggle is no longer needed; the stored setting is cleaned up automatically on upgrade.
- **Fixed: the Frequently Used tab was missing in sticker mode.** Sticker mode restricts the picker to your custom emoji, but its category filter also dropped Frequently Used even when enabled. It now stays available (surfacing your most-used stickers) and follows the "Show frequently used emojis" setting just like normal mode.

### 2.2.1 — 2026-06-25

- **Shortcode convention enforcement** — the emoji trigger field is now labelled **Shortcode** and validates the recommended `:word:` format (wrapped in colons; letters, numbers, `_`, `+`, `-` only) when you add an emoji or change an existing one's shortcode. This prevents bare-word triggers (e.g. `png`) that the formatter would otherwise match anywhere in a post. Existing shortcodes are grandfathered: editing a legacy emoji's other fields won't force you to fix its trigger.
- **Backwards-compatible import** — JSON import still accepts legacy (non-canonical) shortcodes so older exports keep working; it now surfaces a non-blocking notice listing any imported shortcodes that don't follow the convention.

### 2.2.0 — 2026-06-25

- **Custom emoji categories** — custom emojis can now be organized into named tabs in the picker. Assign each emoji a freeform **Category** in the admin panel; emojis sharing a category appear together under their own picker tab, with the category's first emoji as the tab icon. Emojis left without a category stay in the default Custom tab. Categories are included in JSON import/export.
- **Sticker mode** — a new admin toggle ("Emoji Settings" → "Sticker mode") that renders custom emoji as large stickers forum-wide: in posts, the live composer preview, and an enlarged picker grid. The picker adapts responsively to the screen (mobile-friendly). Since only custom emoji are enlarged, the picker is restricted to your custom emoji while sticker mode is on. Off by default; nothing changes unless enabled.

### 2.1.0 — 2026-05-03

- **New admin setting: "Pre-populate with popular emojis"** — controls whether the Frequently Used tab starts with emoji-mart's built-in popular defaults or begins empty. Default ON preserves existing behavior. When OFF, the tab appears only after the user picks their first emoji; picks persist in localStorage.
- Renamed "Recently Used" to "Frequently Used" throughout (locale key unchanged — existing translations are unaffected).

### 2.0.2 — 2026-04-26

- Move picker shadow fix from global CSS to JS inline style.

### 2.0.1 — 2026-04-26

- Fix picker popup missing box-shadow (emoji-mart's `--shadow-color` CSS property clashed with Flarum's).

### 2.0.0 — 2026-04-25

- **Ported to Flarum 2.x.** Requires `flarum/core: ^2.0.0-beta` and `php: ^8.3`.
- Added picker variant and admin console baseline tests.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-04-20

- **Replaced the discontinued [`emoji-button`](https://github.com/joeattardi/emoji-button) (and its archived successor [`picmo`](https://github.com/joeattardi/picmo)) with [`emoji-mart`](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart)** (Missive, MIT). Picker glyphs continue to use [Twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) via a jsDelivr-hosted spritesheet — no extra assets ship with the extension.
- Removed four settings without an emoji-mart analogue. A migration handles the rename and rewrites stored category lists from the old taxonomy to emoji-mart's.
- Bumped requirements to `flarum/core: ^1.8.0` and `php: >=8.1`.
- Renamed package to [`pianotell/flarum-ext-flamoji`](https://github.com/PrimateCoder/flarum-flamoji) which `replace`s the upstream [`the-turk/flarum-flamoji`](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/28095-flamoji) so the two can't be installed together. A migration cleans up orphan settings rows from the upstream extension if it was previously installed.
